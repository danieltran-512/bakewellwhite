## About the project

This project is built using NextJS in `TypeScript`. It uses `MaterialUI` with customised themes; `react-spring` and `framer-motion` as two primary animation libraries. The purpose of this project is to build a live website based on a given prototype with pixel perfect accuracy and experiment various React animation libraries to help with the transition. 
This website is responsive on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
Second, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Only the home page was developed, so access to other routes in the website may result in a 404 error.
